# Drum Machine by Kyle Friel

Hello! Welcome to my drum machine. To build this app, I used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and React. The reason behind this application's developement is because it is apart of the Front End Libraries Course on freeCodeCamp. I spent around 8-10 hours on this; I hope you enjoy!
